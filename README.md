# ePaper Weather Display (Webpage)

A very simple webpage that displays local weather information on an old tablet. It includes a small "full screen" button in the top right, though ou will need to add your own weather API in the code. 

### Interesting Tweak
You can tweak the radar iframe URL to adjust the latitute, longitude, and zoom if you wish. I personally moved the "center" just a little SW of where I live to see incoming rain better (it typically comes from the SW where I live). I also zoomed out just a bit more for the same reason.

For example, in the following URL, the latitude and longituge appear in the `loc=34.77,138.3` part, and the zoom is simply the `8.8` that follows:

`https://www.rainviewer.com/map.html?loc=34.77,138.3,8.8&oC=true&c=3&o=83`
